# `<link rel="serviceworker">` Patch
ðŸ©¹ Global JS monkeypatch for `<link rel="serviceworker">`

## How To Use

Include a `<script>` tag somewhere in your HTML source code. When the `DOMContentLoaded` event fires (or immediately when loaded if it already happened), this script should find the first `<link rel="serviceworker" href="/sw.js">`-like `<link>` tag and register that service worker for you!
